            href="https://www.jcu.edu/academics/communication"
            >Tim Russert

            the digital media track at the John Carroll University communication
            department and teaches classes on digital media, media theory, brand

            communication, technology, and society.
          </p>
         
          <p>
            His research interest and practices are on stories in digital
            spaces, digital media studies, frame analysis, media and religious
            communication, media and culture, digital storytelling and design,
            media aesthetics, human-centered digital design methodologies, web
            development (front end), and non-linear editing systems.

            perspectives to digital storytelling scholarship and provides
            cross-cultural educational programs through digital media. He has
            authored seven books and several scholarly articles. Currently, he
            is working on two projects: documenting untold stories of minority
            cultures and understanding the subtleties in how broadcast and cable
            news frame mass shooting stories on their digital platforms.
            Similarly, he is developing a special digital course on
            communicating the gospel, which is designed for faith-based
            organizations.

            a Catholic non-profit that promotes cross-cultural communication and
            actions. Before joining the teaching academia, he worked in the
            cable industry as a host, an independent executive producer,
            producer, and co-director of two teaching series and
            mini-documentaries for EWTN.
          </p>

            Post-Graduate degree in Journalism from the International Institute
            of Journalism, a Master's degree in Communication Management from
            John Carroll University, USA, and a triple Bachelor of Arts in
            Religious Studies (Imo State University, Nigeria), Philosophy, and
            Theology (Pontifical Urban University, Rome/Seat of Wisdom Major
            Seminary, Owerri). He is a recipient of the Television Academy
            Foundation’s Alex Trebek Fellow for 2022, and EDUCAUSE scholar award
