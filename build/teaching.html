              Georgetown University in 2018. It was designed to provide students
              with an overview and understanding of the fundamentals of
              starting, running, and growing a successful business. Participants
              learned the key elements of formulating a sound business plan,
              raising capital, managing resources, setting goals and objectives,
              identifying customer needs and developing a competitive advantage.
              Through lectures, case studies, group exercises, and discussions
              with experienced entrepreneurs, participants developed the skills
              necessary to successfully launch their own venture. They also
              gained an appreciation for the importance of assessing risks
              associated with entrepreneurship and for determining viable
              strategies for reducing those risks.

              This course explored various leadership and managerial styles to
              effectively lead and manage non-profits. Dr. Emelu developed and
              taught the course in 2017 and 2018 as an adjunct professor at the
              Boler College of Business, John Carroll University. Participants
              learned how to foster collaboration and use servant, spirit, and
              change leadership models to maximize the impact of their
              organizations. Additionally, they developed a better understanding
              of the principles behind each leadership style so that they can
              draw on them as needed to effectively lead a non-profit
              organization. Through this course, participants gained insight
              into how to exercise strong leadership in order to achieve optimum
              results for their non-profit initiatives.

            <p>
              The Spirituality of the Diaconate Order provides a refreshing
              understanding of the Catholic Diaconate journey. It focuses on
              theological, pastoral, spiritual, and practical elements woven
              into the life of a deacon and develops an understanding of how to
              live out the role with reverence for God and service to others.
              The outcome of the course is to inspire deacons who are committed
              to deepening their spirituality through prayerful reflection and
              action. Participants were equipped to recognize and articulate
              their own vocation and spiritual journey while still being able to
              support their ministries with a spirit of joy, justice, truth,
              faith, hope, and love.
