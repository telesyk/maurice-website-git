            A Brief Biography
          </h2>
          <p>
            Dr. Maurice Emelu is the co-director of the
            <a href="https://www.jcu.edu/online-masters-in-digital-marketing-and-communication-strategy">digital marketing & communication strategy graduate program</a>
            and an assistant professor of communication at the
            <a class="link" href="https://www.jcu.edu/academics/communication">Tim Russert Department of Communication, John Carroll
              University,</a>
            Ohio. He leads the digital media track at the John Carroll
            University communication department and teaches classes on digital
            media, media theory, brand storytelling through digital content,
            speech communication, and communication, technology, and society.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            His research interest and practices are on stories in digital
            spaces, digital media studies, frame analysis, media and religious
            communication, media and culture, digital storytelling and design,
            media aesthetics, human-centered digital design methodologies, web
            development (front end), and non-linear editing systems.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            As a first-generation American from Nigeria, he brings diverse
            perspectives to digital storytelling scholarship and provides
            cross-cultural educational programs through digital media. He has
            authored seven books and several scholarly articles. Currently, he
            is working on some significant projects. They include documenting
            untold stories of minority cultures, building a social technology
            that replicates faith rituals from ground up, and understanding
            the subtleties in how broadcast and cable news frame mass shooting
            stories on their digital platforms. Similarly, he is developing a
            special digital course on communicating the gospel for faith-based
            organizations.

            a non-profit that promotes cross-cultural faith communication and
            actions. Before joining the teaching academia, he worked in the
            cable industry as a host, an independent executive producer,
            producer, and co-director of two teaching series and
            mini-documentaries for EWTN. He continues to produce inspiring and
            strengthening contents for the same network, many of which are
            also published through his
            <a class="link" href="https://revemelu.com/"> pastoral website </a> and other
            social media platforms.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            He holds a Doctor of Philosophy degree from Liverpool Hope

          <p>
            Offering food, water, education, and housing to those in need in
            the most impoverished parts of the world. These are carried out
            through Gratia Vobis Ministries,
            <a class="link" href="https://trinityloveinc.org/">Trinity Love Inc.,</a>
            Catholic Churches and nonprofit organizations in beneficiary
            communities.

          <br>
          <p>
            Education scholarship program for children living in poverty in
            Africa. This program is aimed at helping children access quality
            education while also providing them with the necessary supplies
            they need to properly learn and grow. The charity works closely
            with local schools in order to ensure that students have
            everything they need to succeed academically.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Food distributions during festival seasons like Christmas in order
            to help those who are suffering from hunger and malnutrition get
            access to nutritious food items. These grains are distributed
            among the poorest communities around the world.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Financial support for constructing homes for those living below
            the poverty line, who need shelter. This allows individuals living
            in extreme poverty access safe and secure housing that can provide
            them with a sense of security and comfort amidst difficult
            circumstances.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Furthermore, funding is also provided for building places of
            worship so that people can practice their faith without fear or
            judgement while staying connected with their spiritual beliefs
            even when times are tough.
