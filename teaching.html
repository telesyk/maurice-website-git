            Understanding the theories explaining the role of media for us as
            individuals and shaping the development of media industries, helps
            us make wise decisions in our use of media. This course acquaints
            students with the theorists, theories, and research that help us
            understand the role of the media in mass communication and media
            studies—mass media, digital media, social media, and other forms of
            emerging media such as machine learning and AI technologies. It
            looks at these in relation to media effects, the human mind, social
            interactions, culture, economy, politics, and media representations
            and mediatization (JCU Bulletin). At the end of this course,
            students will deepen their understanding of theory so they can make
            better use of media and play a bigger role in the development of new
            media industries. It is a research and writing course for seniors
            and is required for communication majors in digital media.
