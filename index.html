            My research is on stories in digital spaces. This includes frame
            analysis based on digital content analysis; UX-research for
            user-centered digital tools and experiences’ design; the dialogue of
            digital media, culture, and religious communications; and the role
            of aesthetics in digital design and engagements. My creative works
            follow digital storytelling and human-centered methodologies.

            I'm passionate about giving back to the community and promoting a

            champion educational opportunities for those who are
            underprivileged. By doing so, I hope to foster positive change and
            provide an opportunity for growth and progress.

            Sponsoring the less priviledged in the poorest parts of the world is a passionate
            interest. So also providing food and water to the hungry and housing for those
            living on the streets. I founded a non-profit organization, <a href="https://gratiavobisministries.org/">  Gratia
            Vobis Ministries </a>, to live and share Christ's love not only by words,
            but through acts of giving. For me, the poor don't deserve leftovers; they deserve our best.
